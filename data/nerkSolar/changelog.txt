* "conkyrc" can be copied in your home directory as .conkyrc
* "Xresources" can be copied in your home directory as .Xresources or .Xdefaults
* The grun application can be installed and used to launch programs without opening an xterm
* The volumeicon-alsa package can be installed, at least on Debian, and a volume button can be inserted in the tasbar by writting  'volumeicon &' in your '~/.icewm/startup' file
* Worked on an iconset to provide some CDE icons to PCManFM. Iconset originates from CDE desktop and have been brought in .png format by Arenyart (Andrew Enyart, USA). See https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1120392/ for the original theme.
Mainly copied icons and renamed some others to be freedesktop compliant. Modified the theme script to work with Gtk apps. The result is ok for the icons but the navigating arrows are not ok. The iconset can be downloaded there : https://github.com/StephaneLab/CDE-Gtk-Iconset
* Added two wallpapers under CC0 in the theme background directory and removed previous bg.png tile.
* Fixed a problem of font for the clock applet
* Bitstream Vera Serif Roman is a good font for the GTK menus.
* Added time between clics for double clic
* Added blinking cursor for xterm
* Removed the italic option for menu font and windows titlebar font
* Added a menu_en(english) and menu_fr(french) to copy in your ~/.icewm/menu to get a basis for a menu which is freedesktop compliant.
* Made the icons and font a little bigger in the menu

* made pixmaps for the toolbar and worked on the toolbar look
* worked on the pager buttons
* made a new icon for nIceCDE start menu
* removed the conkyrc file from the archive for the moment
* made a .xpm to get a background image

November 11, 2022
* Went back to a more simple toolbar/taskbar because of side effects 
on the log off dialog box.
* Put a gradient option on pager buttons, to allows changes in names of 
the Desks, changing the name's length too much will not show a very good result but it's
now possible.
